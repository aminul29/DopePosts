## Post-Task Git Prompt Policy

After every successful task completion (not only code changes), if this project is a Git repository (`.git` exists), always prompt the user and offer exactly these 3 options:

1. Commit only
2. Commit + push
3. Skip

If this project is not a Git repository, skip this prompt.
